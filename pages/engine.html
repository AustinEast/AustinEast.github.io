        <h3>2d Engine Development</h3>
        <h5>5/10/15-First Post (Arrow keys and space bar for movement)</h5>
        <p>Welcome to the first in what I hope to be a series of posts about developing a 2d game engine. I don't have a specific goal in mind with this, but I would like this to be as feature-rich as possible, and maybe someday it will culminate into a game or something. Who knows! But for now I'll be taking baby steps.</p>
        <p>For this first post, I've got the basics of movement, animation and collision working. I decided to use the Excellent Flixel framework for this project, which is based in Actionscript 3, a language I'm fairly familiar in. Flixel itself makes things even easier, providing many classes tailored specifically to these types of engines. So hopefully development will be fast! I made a little dog as the character. I like him a lot, so he'll probably be the star character for most of these posts, but we shall see! Until next time.</p>
